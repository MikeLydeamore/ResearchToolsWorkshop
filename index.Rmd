# About

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## Today I will cover... 

* RStudio and RStudio Projects
* Avoiding dependency hell with `renv`
* Reproducible and automatically updating workflows with `targets`
* R markdown structure


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
