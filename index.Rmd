# Reproducibility and your research

Reproducibility is one of the cornerstones of science. It was first introduced to me in high school: "Write down your methods in a way someone else could repeat them and get the same answer". Yet, there is an enormous amount of science that doesn't follow that principle. 

Reproducibility of science is a real problem. Estimates have put the cost in biomedicine alone at more than $28 billion annually^[https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002165]. It's not just the financial cost either. Many funding agencies have periods of time in which research must be able to be reproduced.

It's not just that methods aren't fully explained, but implementations are often not shared, or if they are, they don't match what is published.

I have suffered this myself. Recently, a curious student emailed me about model code from my PhD. Written in MATLAB, a language I haven't touched in 6 years, it took me many hours of debugging to get it to run on a modern system. Even then, I doubt I would've been able to produce everything in the associated paper without hours of painful work.

### Discussion
Break out into groups of 2 or 3 and discuss issues and solutions you have seen or used for reproducible research.

## There isn't a silver bullet
Unfortunately, there isn't really a silver bullet to the reproducibility problem. Some people are very good at maintaining strict systems for projects. Some people are less so.

Today, we will learn a bit about reproduciblity, and how we can start to build it into our research so we can at least make _some_ progress on what is a big problem.

## There is more to it than today...
We are really just dipping our toe into the water of reproducibility. There is more to consider: Docker, continuous integration, containerisation/virtualisation, and if we want to go even deeper, different computer architectures, long-term data storage and redundancy.

You could spend an entire career on this (and people do). But for today, let's cover reproducible writing and function-oriented coding, as well as version control, so we can all get a bit better with our research tools.


## Today I will cover... 

* RStudio and RStudio Projects
* Avoiding dependency hell with `renv`
* Reproducible and automatically updating workflows with `targets`
* R markdown structure


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
